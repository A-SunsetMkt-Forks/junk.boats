### What is junk.boats?
junk.boats is a yet another, free to use, open source, and of course, privacy-friendly, temporary email generator. You can use junk.boats to receive emails from sites you don't really want to give your email to. All received emails are publicly stored for 2 hours and then permanently deleted.

### What about privacy?
junk.boats only stores the received emails. No other user data is stored. The emails are automatically deleted after 2 hours. Until then, everyone with the receiving address can view the emails this address received. For analytics, junk.boats uses Cloudflare's anonymous web analytics.

### What are collector, postmaster, and postoffice?
- üìÆ `collector` is a Cloudflare email worker which receives and stores all incoming mails
- üöö `postmaster` is the email distributor in the form of an API powered by a HonoJS Cloudflare worker
- üè§ `postoffice` is the Vite + Svelte frontend which displays the received emails to the user

### How does junk.boats work?
Incoming mails go to the `collector` email worker. It saves the email in a Cloudflare KV database. The Svelte frontend generates a random email address and requests all emails for this address from the `postmaster`. If emails are available, it displays them, sorted by the UNIX timestamp included in the KV entry.

### Why the domain "junk.boats"?
I wanted a domain with "junk" in it, and the .boats TLD was available, so I decided to use that. I might add additional similar domains later.

### Development
More on that soon
